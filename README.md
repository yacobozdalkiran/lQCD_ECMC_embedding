## Event-Chain and Metropolis algorithms for pure gauge SU(3) lattice QCD

This is a set of algorithms for pure gauge SU(3) lattice QCD with Wilson action. 
It contains an implementation of Event-Chain Monte Carlo and Metropolis to generate gauge
configurations.

The compilation uses `CMake` and the package `Eigen` for linear algebra.

### Compilation

First clone the repo anywhere you want :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yacobozdalkiran/lQCD_ECMC_embedding.git
```
